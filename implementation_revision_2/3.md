## Implementation Date
- **Started**: January 12, 2025
- **Completed**: January 12, 2025
- **Total Time**: ~2 hours

## Implemented Components

### 1. Event Sourcing Foundation ✅

#### Event Store (`src/memory/event_sourcing.py`)
```python
class EventStore:
    """Event store for managing events with replay and time travel capabilities."""
    
    Key Features:
    - Immutable event log
    - Event replay for state reconstruction
    - Time travel to any point in history
    - Snapshot support for performance
    - Event subscriptions for real-time updates
    - Thread-safe operations with asyncio locks
```

**Core Methods**:
- `append(event)`: Add event to the store with publishing
- `replay_events(aggregate_id)`: Reconstruct current state
- `get_state_at(aggregate_id, timestamp)`: Time travel
- `subscribe/unsubscribe`: Event notifications
- `create_snapshot`: Performance optimization
- `get_events_by_type/actor`: Filtering capabilities

#### Event Class
```python
@dataclass
class Event:
    id: str
    timestamp: datetime
    type: EventType
    aggregate_id: str
    data: Dict[str, Any]
    actor: str
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
    
    Features:
    - JSON serialization/deserialization
    - Immutable design
    - Rich metadata support
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Event Store Performance
- Event append: O(1) amortized
- State replay: O(n) where n = events since last snapshot
- Time travel: O(n) for events up to timestamp
- Snapshot creation: O(n) for n events
- Memory overhead: ~200 bytes per event

### Cache Performance
- Cache hit: O(1)
- Cache miss with prefetch: O(1) + async prefetch
- Eviction: O(n log n) for n cached items
- Pattern analysis: O(m) for m access history entries

### Memory Tiers
- Short-term: O(1) access, O(n) search
- Long-term: O(k) vector search for k results
- Shared: O(1) access, O(n) search
- Event store: Append O(1), replay O(n)

## Security and Privacy

### Data Protection
- All PII automatically marked
- Consent required before processing
- Automatic anonymization after retention
- Secure hashing for anonymization
- Complete audit trail

### Access Control
- Purpose-based consent model
- Granular permission system
- Actor tracking for all operations
- Immutable audit log

### Compliance Features
- GDPR Article 6: Lawful basis (consent)
- GDPR Article 7: Consent management
- GDPR Article 15: Right of access
- GDPR Article 16: Right to rectification
- GDPR Article 17: Right to erasure
- GDPR Article 20: Data portability
- GDPR Article 25: Privacy by design

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Event Sourcing Design
- **Immutable Events**: Never modify, only append
- **Event Types**: Extensible enum for new event types
- **Aggregate Streams**: Separate streams per aggregate
- **Snapshots**: Automatic at 100 events

### 2. Memory Tier Architecture
- **Cache Layer**: Predictive with ML optimization
- **Short-term**: LRU with capacity limits
- **Long-term**: Vector-based for similarity
- **Shared**: Redis-like for cross-agent

### 3. GDPR Implementation
- **Consent First**: Nothing without consent
- **Purpose Limitation**: Strict purpose enforcement
- **Data Minimization**: Automatic checks
- **Privacy by Design**: Built into core

### 4. Audit Trail Design
- **Complete Coverage**: Every operation logged
- **Retention Policies**: Configurable by type
- **Anonymization**: Consistent hashing
- **Compliance Ready**: Export capabilities

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Time Travel Performance
- **Issue**: Replaying many events is slow
- **Solution**: Automatic snapshots every 100 events

### Challenge 2: Async Generator Error
- **Issue**: `any()` with async generator in GDPR code
- **Solution**: Explicit loop with break for async consent check

### Challenge 3: Event Ordering
- **Issue**: Concurrent events need ordering
- **Solution**: Timestamp + event ID for deterministic order

## Integration Points

### With Agent System
- Agents use `remember()` for storing findings
- `recall()` for retrieving relevant information
